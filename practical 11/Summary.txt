1. I got three kinds of sequences from the given .fa file using what I learned at last few practicals. They are:

SOD2_human sequence: MLSRAVCGTSRQLAPVLAYLGSRQKHSLPDLPYDYGALEPHINAQIMQLHHSKHHAAYVNNLNVTEEKYQEALAKGDVTAQIALQPALKFNGGGHINHSIFWTNLSPNGGGEPKGELLEAIKRDFGSFDKFKEKLTAASVGVQGSGWGWLGFNKERGHLQIAACPNQDPLQGTTGLIPLLGIDVWEHAYYLQYKNVRPDYLKAIWNVINWENVTERYMACKK

2.I collected three sets of score data. They are:
score condition:
human vs mouse:                   1091
human vs random sequence:  -250
mouse vs random sequence:   -250

3.I collected three sets of percentage data. They are:
percentage condition:
Human vs mouse: 89.63963963963964
human vs random: 5.405405405405405
mouse vs random: 5.8558558558558556

High alignment score usually stands for high similarity of the sequences. 
High alignment score (1091, compared to human and random sequence's -250) between human and mouse on SOD2 protein suggests may suggests that
human and mouse may have evolved from the same species. Another hypothesis can be raisedï¼Œ which is SOD2 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal physiological activities
and is widly found in multiple spices. Natural selection may be responsible for the slight variation in the sequence.
